                <h2>Nutrition Fundamentals for Diabetes</h2>
                <p>
                    Good nutrition is a cornerstone of diabetes management. The goal isn't to follow a restrictive 
                    "diabetic diet" but to eat a balanced, nutritious diet that helps maintain stable blood sugar 
                    levels while supporting overall health. What you eat, when you eat, and how much you eat all 
                    affect blood glucose.
                </p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <h4>Key Nutrition Principles</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There's no one-size-fits-all "diabetes diet"</li>
                        <li>Focus on whole, minimally processed foods</li>
                        <li>Carbohydrates have the biggest impact on blood sugar</li>
                        <li>Portion control matters</li>
                        <li>Consistency in meal timing helps with blood sugar management</li>
                        <li>All foods can fit in a healthy eating plan</li>
                        <li>Individual responses to foods vary</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Understanding Macronutrients</h2>

                <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
                <p>
                    Carbohydrates break down into glucose and have the most significant impact on blood sugar. 
                    Understanding carbs is essential for diabetes management.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simple carbohydrates:</strong> Quickly absorbed; cause rapid blood sugar spikes 
                    (sugar, candy, soda, white bread)</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex carbohydrates:</strong> Digested more slowly; provide steady energy 
                    (whole grains, legumes, vegetables)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fiber:</strong> A type of carbohydrate that doesn't raise blood sugar; aids digestion 
                    and helps with satiety</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Proteins</h3>
                <p>
                    Protein has minimal direct effect on blood sugar but is essential for building and repairing tissues. 
                    Include lean protein sources at meals to promote satiety.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lean meats, poultry, and fish</li>
                    <li>Eggs and dairy products</li>
                    <li>Legumes, beans, and lentils</li>
                    <li>Tofu and tempeh</li>
                    <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fats</h3>
                <p>
                    Fats don't directly raise blood sugar but affect insulin sensitivity and heart health. Focus on 
                    healthy fats and limit saturated and trans fats.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Healthy fats:</strong> Olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds, fatty fish (omega-3s)</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit:</strong> Saturated fats (fatty meats, full-fat dairy, butter)</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils, many processed foods)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Carbohydrate Counting</h2>
                <p>
                    Carbohydrate counting helps match insulin doses to food intake (especially for Type 1 diabetes) 
                    and manage blood sugar levels. One carbohydrate serving equals 15 grams of carbohydrates.
                </p>

                <h3>How to Count Carbs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read nutrition labels - check serving size and "Total Carbohydrate"</li>
                    <li>Use measuring cups/spoons or a food scale initially</li>
                    <li>Learn to estimate portions visually over time</li>
                    <li>Use apps or carb counting guides</li>
                    <li>Subtract dietary fiber (if >5g per serving, subtract half the fiber from total carbs)</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Approximate Carb Counts</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 slice of bread = 15g</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup cooked pasta or rice = 15g</li>
                        <li>1 small apple or banana = 15g</li>
                        <li>1 cup milk = 12g</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup cooked beans = 15g</li>
                        <li>1/3 cup cooked quinoa = 15g</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>The Plate Method</h2>
                <p>
                    A simple approach to balanced meals without counting or measuring. Divide your plate:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1/2 of plate:</strong> Non-starchy vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, peppers, tomatoes, cauliflower)</li>
                    <li><strong>1/4 of plate:</strong> Lean protein (chicken, fish, tofu, eggs, lean beef)</li>
                    <li><strong>1/4 of plate:</strong> Carbohydrates (whole grains, starchy vegetables, fruit, legumes)</li>
                    <li><strong>Add:</strong> A serving of low-fat dairy and healthy fats</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load</h2>
                <p>
                    The glycemic index (GI) ranks carbohydrates by how quickly they raise blood sugar. The glycemic 
                    load (GL) considers both the GI and portion size.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low GI foods (55 or less):</strong> Most vegetables, legumes, whole grains, most fruits</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium GI foods (56-69):</strong> Whole wheat products, brown rice, sweet potato</li>
                    <li><strong>High GI foods (70+):</strong> White bread, white rice, potatoes, sugary foods</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Combining high GI foods with protein, fat, or fiber can lower the overall glycemic response.
                </p>

                <h2>Meal Planning Strategies</h2>

                <h3>General Guidelines</h3>

                </ul>

                <h3>Alcohol Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation and with caution:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alcohol can cause delayed hypoglycemia, especially on an empty stomach</li>

                    <li>Wear medical ID and inform companions about diabetes</li>
                    <li>Be aware that alcohol impairs judgment about blood sugar symptoms</li>

                    <ul>
