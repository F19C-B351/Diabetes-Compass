                <h2>What is Type 1 Diabetes?</h2>
                <p>
                    Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks and destroys 
                    the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, the body cannot regulate 
                    blood sugar levels effectively. Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it's often 
                    diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Key Facts About Type 1 Diabetes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accounts for approximately 5-10% of all diabetes cases</li>
                        <li>Not caused by lifestyle factors or diet</li>
                        <li>Currently not preventable or curable</li>
                        <li>Requires lifelong insulin therapy</li>
                        <li>Can be managed successfully with proper care</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>
                    The exact cause of Type 1 diabetes is not fully understood, but it involves a combination of 
                    genetic and environmental factors. It is NOT caused by eating too much sugar or poor lifestyle choices.
                </p>

                <h3>Risk Factors Include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Having certain genes increases susceptibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Having a parent or sibling with T1D increases risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Two peak periods - early childhood (4-7 years) and adolescence (10-14 years)</li>
                    <li><strong>Geography:</strong> More common in people living farther from the equator</li>
                    <li><strong>Viral infections:</strong> Some viruses may trigger the autoimmune response</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Type 1 diabetes symptoms often develop quickly, over a period of days or weeks. It's crucial to 
                    recognize these symptoms early to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication.
                </p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>Common Symptoms</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excessive thirst (polydipsia)</li>
                        <li>Frequent urination (polyuria), especially at night</li>
                        <li>Extreme hunger (polyphagia)</li>
                        <li>Unintended weight loss</li>
                        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                        <li>Blurred vision</li>
                        <li>Slow-healing wounds</li>
                        <li>Fruity-smelling breath (sign of DKA)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Emergency Warning:</strong> If you or someone you know experiences these symptoms, 
                    especially rapid breathing, nausea, vomiting, or confusion, seek immediate medical attention.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed through blood tests that measure glucose levels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fasting plasma glucose test:</strong> Blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher after fasting</li>
                    <li><strong>Random plasma glucose test:</strong> Blood sugar of 200 mg/dL or higher at any time</li>
                    <li><strong>A1C test:</strong> Average blood sugar over 2-3 months; 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes</li>
                    <li><strong>Autoantibody tests:</strong> Detect antibodies that attack beta cells</li>
                    <li><strong>C-peptide test:</strong> Measures insulin production</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Daily Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Managing Type 1 diabetes requires a comprehensive approach involving insulin therapy, blood sugar 
                    monitoring, nutrition, exercise, and emotional well-being. With modern tools and knowledge, people 
                    with T1D live full, active lives.
                </p>

                <h3>Insulin Therapy</h3>
                <p>
                    Since the body no longer produces insulin, external insulin is essential for survival. Insulin 
                    regimens vary based on individual needs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multiple daily injections (MDI):</strong> Long-acting (basal) insulin once or twice daily, 
                    plus rapid-acting (bolus) insulin with meals</li>
                    <li><strong>Insulin pump therapy:</strong> Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid closed-loop systems:</strong> Automated insulin delivery based on CGM data</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Blood Sugar Monitoring</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fingerstick testing:</strong> Checking blood glucose several times per day</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs):</strong> Real-time glucose readings throughout the day</li>
                    <li><strong>Target ranges:</strong> Generally 70-180 mg/dL, but individualized by healthcare provider</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Carbohydrate Counting</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning to count carbohydrates helps determine the correct insulin dose for meals. Working with 
                    a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) can help you master this skill.
                </p>

                    <h4>Living Well with Type 1 Diabetes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Many athletes, performers, professionals, and everyday heroes live successfully with Type 1 diabetes. 
                        With proper management, you can:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participate in all types of physical activities and sports</li>
                        <li>Have a healthy pregnancy</li>
                        <li>Pursue any career path</li>
                        <li>Travel the world</li>
                        <li>Live a long, healthy life</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Preventing Complications</h2>
                <p>
                    Maintaining good blood sugar control reduces the risk of long-term complications. Regular monitoring 
                    and healthcare visits are essential:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep A1C levels in your target range (typically below 7% for adults)</li>
                    <li>Have regular eye exams (annually)</li>
                    <li>Monitor kidney function</li>
                    <li>Care for your feet daily</li>
                    <li>Maintain cardiovascular health</li>
                    <li>Attend regular dental checkups</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Emotional and Mental Health</h2>
                <p>
                    Living with Type 1 diabetes can be emotionally challenging. "Diabetes burnout" and "diabetes distress" 
                    are real experiences. It's important to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect with others who have T1D through support groups</li>
                    <li>Work with mental health professionals experienced in chronic disease</li>
                    <li>Give yourself permission to have difficult days</li>
                    <li>Celebrate your successes, big and small</li>
                    <li>Remember: you are more than your blood sugar numbers</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Research and Hope for the Future</h2>
                <p>
                    Research into Type 1 diabetes continues to advance. Current areas of investigation include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevention strategies for at-risk individuals</li>
                    <li>Immunotherapies to preserve beta cell function</li>
                    <li>Beta cell replacement therapies (including stem cell research)</li>
                    <li>Artificial pancreas systems</li>
                    <li>Improved insulin formulations</li>
                    <li>Cure research through organizations like JDRF and ADA</li>
                </ul>
