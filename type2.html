                <h2>What is Type 2 Diabetes?</h2>
                <p>
                    Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition that affects how your body metabolizes sugar (glucose). 
                    In Type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin (insulin resistance) or doesn't 
                    produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90-95% 
                    of all diabetes cases.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Key Facts About Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most common form of diabetes</li>
                        <li>Can develop at any age, but most common in adults over 45</li>
                        <li>Increasingly diagnosed in children, adolescents, and young adults</li>
                        <li>Often preventable through lifestyle modifications</li>
                        <li>Can sometimes be reversed or put into remission with significant lifestyle changes</li>
                        <li>Management improves quality of life and reduces complications</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>
                    Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas stops 
                    producing enough insulin. Multiple factors contribute to this condition:
                </p>

                <h3>Risk Factors Include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Being overweight or obese, especially with excess abdominal fat</li>
                    <li><strong>Inactivity:</strong> Physical inactivity increases risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Having a parent or sibling with Type 2 diabetes</li>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Risk increases after age 45</li>
                    <li><strong>Race/ethnicity:</strong> Higher risk in African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, and Pacific Islander populations</li>
                    <li><strong>Prediabetes:</strong> Having blood sugar levels higher than normal but not yet diabetic</li>
                    <li><strong>Gestational diabetes:</strong> Having diabetes during pregnancy</li>
                    <li><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):</strong> Increases risk in women</li>
                    <li><strong>High blood pressure:</strong> Above 140/90 mmHg</li>
                    <li><strong>Abnormal cholesterol levels:</strong> HDL below 35 mg/dL or triglycerides above 250 mg/dL</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>Breaking the Stigma</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Type 2 diabetes is NOT caused simply by "eating too much sugar" or being "lazy." 
                        It's a complex metabolic condition influenced by genetics, environment, socioeconomic factors, and many 
                        other variables. No one "deserves" diabetes, and everyone deserves compassionate care and support, 
                        regardless of their health status or body size.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Type 2 diabetes often develops gradually, and symptoms may be mild or absent in the early stages. 
                    Some people live with undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes for years. Common symptoms include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased thirst and frequent urination</li>
                    <li>Increased hunger</li>
                    <li>Unintended weight loss (less common than in Type 1)</li>
                    <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                    <li>Blurred vision</li>
                    <li>Slow-healing sores or frequent infections</li>
                    <li>Areas of darkened skin, usually in armpits and neck (acanthosis nigricans)</li>
                    <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed through blood tests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A1C test:</strong> 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes; 5.7-6.4% indicates prediabetes</li>
                    <li><strong>Fasting plasma glucose:</strong> 126 mg/dL or higher after 8-hour fast</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral glucose tolerance test:</strong> 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after drinking glucose solution</li>
                    <li><strong>Random plasma glucose:</strong> 200 mg/dL or higher with symptoms</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Prediabetes: An Opportunity for Prevention</h2>
                <p>
                    Prediabetes means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified 
                    as diabetes. This is a critical window for intervention. Studies show that lifestyle changes can 
                    prevent or delay the progression from prediabetes to Type 2 diabetes.
                </p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <h4>Preventing Type 2 Diabetes</h4>
                    <p>If you have prediabetes or are at risk, these steps can significantly reduce your risk:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lose 5-7% of your body weight if overweight</li>
                        <li>Get at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week</li>
                        <li>Eat a balanced diet rich in whole foods, vegetables, and lean proteins</li>
                        <li>Quit smoking</li>
                        <li>Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night)</li>
                        <li>Manage stress effectively</li>
                        <li>Regular health screenings and checkups</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Management Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    Managing Type 2 diabetes typically involves a combination of lifestyle modifications and, when 
                    necessary, medication. The goal is to keep blood sugar levels in target range to prevent complications 
                    and maintain quality of life.
                </p>

                <h3>Lifestyle Modifications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Focus on whole foods, portion control, and consistent meal timing. 
                    Work with a registered dietitian for personalized guidance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical activity:</strong> Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity. Aim for a 
                    combination of aerobic exercise and strength training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight management:</strong> Even modest weight loss (5-10% of body weight) can significantly 
                    improve blood sugar control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stress management:</strong> Chronic stress affects blood sugar. Practice relaxation 
                    techniques, meditation, or yoga.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Poor sleep affects insulin sensitivity. Prioritize good sleep hygiene.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid smoking:</strong> Smoking increases risk of diabetes complications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Medication Options</h3>
                <p>When lifestyle changes alone aren't enough, medications help manage blood sugar levels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Metformin:</strong> Usually the first medication prescribed; reduces glucose production in the liver</li>
                    <li><strong>Sulfonylureas:</strong> Stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin</li>
                    <li><strong>DPP-4 inhibitors:</strong> Help reduce blood sugar levels</li>
                    <li><strong>GLP-1 receptor agonists:</strong> Slow digestion and help pancreas produce insulin</li>
                    <li><strong>SGLT2 inhibitors:</strong> Help kidneys remove glucose through urine</li>
                    <li><strong>Insulin therapy:</strong> May be needed as the disease progresses</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Blood Sugar Monitoring</h2>
                <p>Regular monitoring helps you understand how food, activity, and medications affect your blood sugar:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Self-monitoring:</strong> Check blood glucose with a meter as recommended by your healthcare team</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs):</strong> Some people with Type 2 diabetes use CGMs for real-time data</li>
                    <li><strong>A1C testing:</strong> Have your A1C checked at least twice a year, or more frequently if not meeting goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Target ranges:</strong> Work with your healthcare provider to establish personalized targets</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Preventing Complications</h2>
                <p>
                    Type 2 diabetes can affect many parts of the body, but good management significantly reduces 
                    complications risk:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cardiovascular health:</strong> Monitor blood pressure and cholesterol; take medications as prescribed</li>
                    <li><strong>Kidney health:</strong> Annual kidney function tests; control blood pressure and blood sugar</li>
                    <li><strong>Eye health:</strong> Annual dilated eye exams to screen for retinopathy</li>
                    <li><strong>Foot care:</strong> Daily foot inspections; prompt treatment of wounds or infections</li>
                    <li><strong>Nerve health:</strong> Good blood sugar control prevents neuropathy</li>
                    <li><strong>Dental health:</strong> Regular dental checkups; gum disease is more common with diabetes</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Type 2 Diabetes Remission</h2>
                <p>
                    Some people with Type 2 diabetes achieve remission, meaning blood sugar levels return to normal 
                    or prediabetic range without diabetes medications. This is most often achieved through:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Significant weight loss (often 10-15% of body weight)</li>
                    <li>Very low-calorie or low-carbohydrate diets under medical supervision</li>
                    <li>Bariatric surgery in appropriate candidates</li>
                    <li>Intensive lifestyle interventions early after diagnosis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Remission requires continued lifestyle maintenance and regular monitoring. 
                    Discuss remission possibilities with your healthcare team.
                </p>

                <h2>Living Well with Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
                <p>
                    Type 2 diabetes is a manageable condition. Many people with T2D live long, healthy, active lives 
                    by staying engaged with their health:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build a strong healthcare team: doctor, diabetes educator, dietitian, and mental health professional</li>
                    <li>Stay informed about new treatments and research</li>
                    <li>Connect with diabetes communities for support</li>
                    <li>Set realistic, achievable goals</li>
                    <li>Celebrate progress, not perfection</li>
                    <li>Be kind to yourself on difficult days</li>
                </ul>
