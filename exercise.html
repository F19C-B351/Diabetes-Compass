                <h2>Benefits of Exercise for Diabetes</h2>
                <p>
                    Physical activity is a powerful tool for managing diabetes. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, 
                    helps control blood sugar levels, supports cardiovascular health, aids in weight management, and 
                    improves overall quality of life. You don't need to be an athlete - any movement counts!
                </p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <h4>Exercise Benefits Include:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved insulin sensitivity lasting 24-72 hours after exercise</li>
                        <li>Lower blood sugar levels</li>
                        <li>Reduced cardiovascular disease risk</li>
                        <li>Better blood pressure and cholesterol levels</li>
                        <li>Weight management and increased muscle mass</li>
                        <li>Improved mood and reduced stress</li>
                        <li>Better sleep quality</li>
                        <li>Increased energy and stamina</li>
                        <li>Stronger bones and reduced fall risk</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Exercise Recommendations</h2>
                <p>
                    The American Diabetes Association recommends the following for adults with diabetes:
                </p>

                <h3>Aerobic Exercise</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity</li>
                    <li>Spread over at least 3 days per week, with no more than 2 consecutive days without activity</li>
                    <li>Examples: brisk walking, swimming, cycling, dancing, water aerobics</li>
                    <li>Or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Resistance Training</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2-3 sessions per week on non-consecutive days</li>
                    <li>Target all major muscle groups</li>
                    <li>Examples: weight machines, free weights, resistance bands, bodyweight exercises, yoga</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Flexibility and Balance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2-3 times per week</li>
                    <li>Especially important for older adults to prevent falls</li>
                    <li>Examples: yoga, tai chi, stretching routines</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Reduce Sedentary Time</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Break up prolonged sitting every 30 minutes</li>
                    <li>Stand, stretch, or walk for 3 minutes</li>
                    <li>This is important for blood sugar management even if you exercise regularly</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Blood Sugar Management During Exercise</h2>
                <p>
                    Exercise affects blood sugar differently depending on the type, intensity, and duration of activity, 
                    as well as your medication regimen.
                </p>

                <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check blood sugar before, during (for longer sessions), and after exercise</li>
                    <li>Safe range to start exercise: typically 100-250 mg/dL (varies individually)</li>
                    <li>If below 100 mg/dL, eat 15g of carbs before starting</li>
                    <li>If above 250 mg/dL (Type 1) and have ketones, postpone exercise</li>
                    <li>Exercise can lower blood sugar for up to 24 hours after activity</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>How Different Exercises Affect Blood Sugar</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Aerobic exercise:</strong> Usually lowers blood sugar during and after</li>
                        <li><strong>High-intensity interval training (HIIT):</strong> May cause temporary blood sugar increase, followed by decrease</li>
                        <li><strong>Resistance training:</strong> May cause slight increase during exercise, then decrease afterward</li>
                        <li><strong>Anaerobic/very intense exercise:</strong> Can temporarily raise blood sugar due to stress hormones</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Preventing Hypoglycemia During Exercise</h3>
                <p>For people taking insulin or medications that can cause low blood sugar:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always carry fast-acting carbs (glucose tablets, juice, candy)</li>
                    <li>Exercise with a buddy who knows about your diabetes</li>
                    <li>Wear medical ID</li>
                    <li>Consider reducing insulin doses before planned exercise (discuss with healthcare team)</li>
                    <li>May need snacks during prolonged exercise (every 30-60 minutes)</li>
                    <li>Monitor for delayed hypoglycemia, especially overnight after evening exercise</li>
                    <li>Keep snacks and glucose readily available at home after exercise</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Adjusting for Exercise (Type 1 Diabetes)</h3>
                <p>Strategies to prevent low blood sugar:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce bolus insulin for meals before exercise</li>
                    <li>Reduce basal rates before, during, and after exercise (if using pump)</li>
                    <li>Consume extra carbohydrates before and during exercise</li>
                    <li>Combine strategies based on exercise type and intensity</li>
                    <li>Keep detailed records to identify patterns and adjust approach</li>
                    <li>Work with diabetes educator to develop personalized strategies</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Getting Started Safely</h2>

                <div class="warning-box">

                    People with diabetes successfully participate in all types of sports, from recreational to elite 
                    competitive levels. Many professional athletes have Type 1 diabetes!
                </p>

                <h3>Tips for Sports Participation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inform coaches and teammates about your diabetes</li>
                    <li>Keep diabetes supplies easily accessible during practice and games</li>
                    <li>Test blood sugar more frequently around sports activities</li>
                    <li>Learn how your sport specifically affects your blood sugar</li>

                <p>If you have peripheral neuropathy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose low-impact activities to reduce foot injury risk</li>
                    <li>Inspect feet daily for blisters, cuts, or irritation</li>
                    <li>Wear proper, well-fitting athletic shoes</li>
                    <li>Avoid activities that cause foot trauma</li>
                    <li>Consider swimming, cycling, or upper body exercises</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Exercise with Retinopathy</h3>
                <p>If you have diabetic retinopathy, especially proliferative retinopathy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid activities that increase blood pressure dramatically</li>

                    <li>Low-impact aerobics are generally safe</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Exercising in Different Environments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hot weather:</strong> Stay hydrated; monitor blood sugar more frequently; heat can affect insulin absorption</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold weather:</strong> Keep insulin and equipment from freezing; protect extremities</li>
                    <li><strong>High altitude:</strong> Blood sugar may be less predictable; extra monitoring needed</li>
                </ul>
